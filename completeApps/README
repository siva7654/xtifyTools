This is a fully configured and working iOS project with Xtify Push SDK 2.x for iOS, PhoneGap Cordova 1.7.0 and a simple JavaScript Feed parser that will list a YouTube video feed of your choice and play a selected video from within your app.

In order to get Xtify this working for your own project, you'll need to do a few things:
- Create an account and Xtify AppKey by visiting http://console.xtify.com > App Manager
  - You'll also need to build this app with your own Apple provisioning profile and Push Certificiate via http://developer.apple.com
- Enter your Xtify AppKey in XtifyLib > XtifyGlobal.h
- Enter your own JSONC YouTube feed in www/js/main.js
  - It must be in the format: http://gdata.youtube.com/feeds/api/users/USERNAME/uploads?v=2&alt=jsonc&max-results=25
  - Or feel free to hack away to use a feed format of your choice

This project is for demonstration purposes only and is provided AS-IS with no warranties provided of any kind. 

Also, this app won't fly if you submit it the iTunes store as it is. I guarantee it. You need to use this as a base for a unique idea of your own.

PLEASE improve upon this and fork it!
